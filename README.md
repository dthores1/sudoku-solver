# Sudoku Solvers

This repository contains algorithms to solve sudoku puzzles. The entry functions will return a completed puzzle when passed a valid input. 

## Expected formats

The functions assume a valid 9x9 grid, an array of arrays implemented with several assumed values and where all unknown values are represented by zeros. This should resemble the following: 

```
    let board = [
        [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
        [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
        [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
        [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
        [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
    ];
```
